the sun did not shine
it was too wet to play
so we sat in the house
all that cold cold wet day

I sat there with Sally
we sat there, we two
and I said how I wish
we had something to do

too wet to go out
and too cold to play ball
so we sat in the house
we did nothing at all

so all we could do was to
sit sit sit sit 
and we did not like it
not one little bit

and then something went BUMP!
